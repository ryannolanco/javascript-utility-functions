JavaScript Utility Functions Repository
Welcome to my collection of JavaScript functions! This repository serves as a curated library of utility functions that I’ve developed across a variety of projects. These functions reflect a wide range of use cases and problem-solving approaches, showcasing my experience in crafting efficient and reusable code.

Overview
Each function is designed to perform a specific task and is housed in its own file for clarity and organization. In cases where functions are closely related or interdependent, you’ll find multiple functions grouped together within a single file for convenience.

Although this project utilizes React for demonstration purposes, the core focus is on the JavaScript functions themselves. Each function is framework-agnostic and can be integrated into any JavaScript-based project.

Features
Reusable Functions: Clean and modular code ready for use in various projects.
Clear Documentation: Each function is accompanied by comments explaining its purpose, parameters, and expected output.
Organized Structure: Files are structured logically, with related functions grouped for better discoverability.
Diverse Use Cases: The repository includes functions for data manipulation, algorithm implementation, utility operations, and more.
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/javascript-utility-functions.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd javascript-utility-functions
Import and use any function in your project. For example:

javascript
Copy
Edit
import exampleFunction from './functions/exampleFunction';

const result = exampleFunction(input);
console.log(result);
Technologies Used
JavaScript: All functions are written in pure JavaScript, focusing on compatibility and performance.
React: Used in this repository for showcasing examples, but the functions themselves are independent of the React framework.
